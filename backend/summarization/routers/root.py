-------

This module provides the base route (`/`) for the summarization microservice.

Purpose:
- Acts as a liveness probe for infrastructure and sanity checks.
- Confirms the service is running and shows the active model in use.

This is typically used by load balancers, orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes),
or humans checking service availability.

Route:
    GET /  â†’  Returns service status and model ID.
