healthcheck.py
--------------

This FastAPI router handles the `/healthcheck` endpoint for the summarization service.

It delegates health validation to the `check_model_health()` function, which verifies
the connectivity and availability of the Ollama backend and ensures the target model
is registered and ready.

This endpoint is useful for container orchestration (e.g., readiness probes),
monitoring tools, or health dashboards to ensure model infrastructure is operational.

Route:
    GET /healthcheck  â†’  Returns model availability status and metadata.
